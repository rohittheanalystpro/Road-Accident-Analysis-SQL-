# Road-Accident-Analysis-SQL-
This repository contains SQL queries designed to analyze data related to road accidents. The goal of this analysis is to provide insights into various factors contributing to accidents, such as causes, vehicle types, weather conditions, and more. The queries in this script are structured to examine accident trends, severity distribution, vehicle involvement, driver demographics, and other accident-related factors.

## Queries Overview

The following types of analyses are covered in the queries:

- **Accident Count**: Basic queries to count total accidents and breakdown by various categories.
- **Accident Causes**: Identifying the most common causes of accidents and their frequency.
- **Accident Severity**: Distribution of accident severity and the percentage of injuries.
- **Driver Demographics**: Analyzing accidents based on the driver's age, gender, and educational level.

## Usage

1. **Create Database**: The script starts by creating a new database `road_accident_database`.
2. **Run Queries**: Each query can be executed separately to generate insights about different aspects of road accidents.
3. **Interpret Results**: Results from these queries can be used for further analysis or visualization to identify trends, improve road safety measures, or influence policy decisions.

Feel free to modify the queries according to your data structure or specific analysis requirements.
